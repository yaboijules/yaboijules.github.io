==============================================
1.
    No issues, just wrote the scripts. I intially was going to generate a random integer to get the
    noun from the list in problem 1, but random.choice() seemed simpler.

==============================================
2.
    a) the script:

    import random

    noun = input('Enter a noun: ')
    adjective = input('Enter an adjective: ')
    noun_list = ['house','car','tunnel','castle','field']
    print('The ' + adjective + ' ' + noun + ' is in the ' + random.choice(noun_list) + '.')


    b) examples:
    
    Enter a noun: horse
    Enter an adjective: fat
    The fat horse is in the tunnel.

    Enter a noun: boat
    Enter an adjective: wet
    The wet boat is in the tunnel.

    Enter a noun: car
    Enter an adjective: fast
    The fast car is in the house.


2.
    a) script:
        
    credits = eval(input("How many credits will you be taking next quarter? "))
    if credits > 19:
        tuition = 12803 + (credits-18)*615
    elif credits <= 18 and credits >= 12:
        tuition = 12803
    elif credits < 12 and credits > 0:
        tuition = credits * 615

    if credits == 0:
        print('you dont even go to school here')
    else:
        print('Your tuition is $' + str(tuition) + '.')


    b) examples:
        
    ========= RESTART: C:/Users/JPRYMAR/Desktop/python/IT 211/assn2-2.py =========
    How many credits will you be taking next quarter? 24
