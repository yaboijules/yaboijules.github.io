    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>My name is Julian Rymar. I am a music major at DePaul studying clarinet performance. I'm in my senior year and begining to apply for graduate studies.</p>
    <p>Outside of music, I enjoy playing video games. My current favorite game is Counter Strike: Global Offensive.</p>
    
    <h2>Curve of Forgetting:</h2>
    <p>This article pertains to memory retainment and the importance of regular review when learning new concepts.</p>
    <p>If you don't do anything with the information you've learned, the next day you lose more than half of it. By a week, you retain nearly none of it. By reviewing regularly, as little as 5 minutes a day, you'll be able to more easily remember the information you've learned weeks or months down the line. </p>
